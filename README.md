# wishlist
about me: Hello, I am Trenton. I am an aspiring web developer and have been caught in the dreaded impostor/tutorial loop for a while. With this project, I hope to break that cycle by creating something of my own. 

This is my first official web development project / web app. I intend to use react and either firebase or mongodb/mongoose to acheive this. 

My idea for this project is to make an interactive wish list app. My idea is to let people create a wishlist and maintain it themselves along with publicly sharing it.

There are a number of features I would like to implement. For example:
- Only owners of a wishlist can edit the wishlist
- A notification/alert will be sent to the owner when somebody purchases an item on the wishlist, this may include the item purchased and the purchaser's name if available or openly shared
- wishlist or item categories. Items may be given a category and or an owner can categorize their wish lists by item type or other category they want. 
- I would like it if the wishlists were publicly readable via an identifying link or other method. This would allow people to share their lists without the viewer needing an account
    -- perhaps there can be an option for public and private lists where private lists are only shared with other specified users.
- wishlist filters for category, price, vendor, etc... 

these are just some ideas I had for this project and I hope to be able to implement them.
